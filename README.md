Python script that fetches pdf's from a mail server and merges them into one pdf


========================= RUNNING DETAILS =========================

You'll need pyPdf, imaplib and all of their dependencies (python etc.)
If your linux/unix distribution does not provide a pyPdf package, you may consider to download the source (of a slightly modified pypdf) from here: https://github.com/PooSham/pypdf

If you have git installed, simply run this from the terminal:
git pull https://github.com/PooSham/pypdf.git

This will fetch the latest version from https://github.com/PooSham/pypdf.git and put it in a folder called pypdf.
